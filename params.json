And, maybe you might like some of the projects I might be working on. I use Visual Studio as my primary IDE. Such project will be done using C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. I am so excited to be on the platform where most developers are and sharing the knowledge as well as acquire knowledge from the more advance developers. I am still a junior developer and very eager to learn new things. Feel free to interact with me via twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThokozaniZakwe\">Thokozani Zakwe</a>.
